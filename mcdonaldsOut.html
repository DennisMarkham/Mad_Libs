<p>McDonald's is an American fast <span id = "1o"></span> company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in <span id = "2o"></span>. They rechristened their business as a <span id = "3o"></span> stand, and later turned the company into a franchise, with the Golden <span id = "4o"></span>s logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in <span id = "5o"></span>. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.

McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across <span id = "6o"></span> outlets as of 2018. Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they also feature <span id = "7o"></span> products, breakfast items, <span id = "8o"></span> drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the <span id = "9o"></span>ness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to two reports published in 2018, McDonald's is the world's forth-largest private employer with 1.7 million employees (behind Walmart with 2.3 million employees).</p>
