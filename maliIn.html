<!-- <p>Musa I (c. 1280 – c. 1337) or Mansa Musa was the tenth Mansa, which translates to "sultan", "conqueror",or "<span id = "1o"></span>",of the wealthy West African Islamic Mali Empire. At the time of Musa's rise to the throne, the Malian Empire consisted of territory formerly belonging to the Ghana Empire in present-day southern <span id = "2o"></span> and in Melle (Mali) and the immediate surrounding areas. Musa held many titles, including "Emir of Melle", "Lord of the Mines of Wangara", "<span id = "3o"></span> of Ghanata", and at least <span = "4o"></span> others.  Mansa Musa conquered <span id = "5o"></span> cities, each with surrounding districts containing villages and estates. During his reign, Mali may have been the largest producer of <span id = "6o"></span> in the world. </p>
<p>What is known about the kings of the Malian Empire is taken from the writings of Arab scholars, including Al-Umari, Abu-sa'id Uthman ad-Dukkali, Ibn Khaldun, and <span id = "7o"></span>. According to Ibn-Khaldun's comprehensive history of the Malian kings, Mansa Musa's grandfather was Abu-Bakr Keita (the Arabic equivalent to Bakari or Bogari, original id unknown − not the sahabiyy Abu Bakr).  Abu-Bakr did not ascend the throne, and his son, Musa's father, <span id = "8o"></span>, has no significance in the history of Mali.</p> -->
